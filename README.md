# Isometric-ELSSLA

Imagine, November 1979, you are with your friends on arcade's house near your house fighting coin-for-coin for put the first 3 letters of your name on the high score of the newest Atari's game...but hey? It's 2017, you probably never played this arcade (but we still love you ; ). We have smartphones, we live in a world with colors (I can even see a nice rainbow flag from here) and TKS GOD! We still drink and compete with our friends! So, download and play with your friends on your local network to get highest score and make it personal with head-to-head score.
Choose your ship and play because Everybory Loves Space Shooters Like Asteroid.
