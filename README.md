# Isometric-ELSSLA

Imagine! November 1979, you and your friends are in arcade's house close to home fighting coin-by-coin to put the first 3 letters of your name on the high score of the newest Atari's game...but hey!? It's 2017, you probably never played this arcade and me too. Today we have smartphones, we live in a world with colors, I can even see a nice rainbow flag from here and TKS GOD! We still drink and play with our friends! So, download and play with your friends on your local network to get highest score and make it personal with head-to-head score. 
Choose your ship and play because Everybory Loves Space Shooters Like Asteroid!
